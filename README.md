I’m @IEGCO an Industrial Engineer 
I’m interested in Operation Research and Project Management of engineering projects
I’m currently learning about optimization algorithms that are used to find optimal solutions for Operational planning and long term planning for companies or projects. Some 
Mathematical Optimization and Metaheuristics I´m exploring are LP, MILP, NLP, MINLP, GA, PSO, CP, SCOP, QP with solvers like Gurobi, CPLEX, SCIP, and GLPK and also with the 
frameworks Pyomo, Or-Tools and PuLP. I’m looking to collaborate on those areas, especially problems related to Project Scheduling
